  - **ce** - miscellaneous Erlang/OTP programming support library
  - **claw** - CLAW is an embryonic compiler from Core Erlang to Common Lisp.

  - **distel** -Emacs add-on for communication with Erlang nodes (+ dev tools).
  - **edep** - Dependecy generator for erlang files
  - **edoc** - EDoc lets you write the documentation of an Erlang program as comments in the source code, 
     using Javadoc-style tags and XHTML markup. Note that the latest version of the syntax_tools application
     is nowadays part of the standard Erlang/OTP distribution. The Jungerl version is frozen.
  - **eldap** - This is `eldap`, the Erlang LDAP library.
  - **enfs** - Minimal NFS v2 server in Erlang
  - **epop** - A POP3 server/client package.
  - **eradius** - RADIUS authentication/accounting
  - **erlang_automated_build** - erlang_automated_build is a shell script which will run some or all of: 
     CVS download of code , a full compile, a test suite,  a Dialyzer analysis, a Tsunami load test The results
     of these are graphed and copied to a location as a web page. There is also e-mail notification on fail/success.
  - **erl_cgi** - a cgi-erlang interface with a lot of nice features, such as esp scripts
  - **erl_img** - Image processing stuff (bmp, gif, jpeg, png, xpm, tiff, mpeg)
  - **erlmerge** - No description in the file ./lib/erlmerge/doc/short-desc yet!
  - **erlspect** - Erlspect is a simple tool for automating interactive text based applications like telnet etc.
    And also for testing such applications.
  - **ermacs** - an erlang clone of emacs.
  - **esmb** - This is an implementation of a subset of the SMB protocol.
  - **ex11** - This is an Erlang-X11 binding, i.e an implementation of the X11 protocol in Erlang.
  - **fd_server** - No description in the file ./lib/fd_server/doc/short-desc yet!
  - **ftpd** - No description in the file ./lib/ftpd/doc/short-desc yet!

  - **gregexp** - This module extends the regexp module in OTP R7B-1 with support for submatches (the \(...\)
    syntax in SED regular expressions). This makes it possible to retrieve several components of a match with
    a single evaluation of a regexp.
  - **gtkNode** -  a c-node that gives access to a large subset of GTK2
  - **ibrowse** - A powerful HTTP/1.1 client written in erlang

  - **lersp** - an Erlang interpreter for an approximation of Scheme
  - **lines** - Efficient array-of-lines ADT. Allows for append, as well as insert, replace, delete in any position
